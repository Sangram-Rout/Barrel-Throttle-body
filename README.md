# Barrel-Throttle-body
A standard butterfly throttle body has a central axis which restricts air flow even when wide open. This is overcome by using a barrel throttle body which allows 
a clear passage for airflow at Wide open throttle conditions helping achieve higher top end power. 
Also, check out the  demo of the project on Vimeo:
